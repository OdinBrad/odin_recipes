    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This roasted potato salad is a tasty alternative to the typical picnic potato salad. Simply roast red potatoes then toss with bacon, eggs, green onion, celery, and mayo. Pretty easy to make, and you can adjust most ingredients to suit your tastes.</p>

        <li>Spread potatoes onto a baking sheet; drizzle with olive oil.</li>
